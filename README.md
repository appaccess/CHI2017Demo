Interaction proxies are a strategy for runtime repair and enhancement of the accessibility of mobile apps, allowing third-party developers and researchers to modify interaction with a mobile app to improve its accessibility.

These code samples show implementation details of interaction proxies.

All examples in our paper/video are implemented in Code/app/src/main/java/xiaoyiz/interactionproxy/, with file names like xxxxxxService.java
